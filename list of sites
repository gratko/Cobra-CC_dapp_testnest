So this isn't code, but I guess this is a good way to start sharing ideas and notes.  

Just a little list of the dapps or web3.0 sites that I think are cool:

1) Market place for cryptolectables
https://opensea.io/

2) Answer questions and earn ETH
https://cent.co/

3) Of course the game, with my referrence link.  You can use your own ETH address in place of mine and that will be your ref link

4) Smart contract creation platform that I started using.  It was cool since it was free at first, but messed up the first few I tried.
Also, since I use it to interface with some of the contracts I created, it doesn't feel like I have 100% control over them.

5) The latest blockchain dApp game I started messing with.  If you go to their discord and tell them I sent you, the one dev will gift you
some axies to get started.  It's really cheap to hatch and to fight them it costs nothing and will gain their experience.
